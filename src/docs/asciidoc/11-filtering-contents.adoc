=== Filtering Shadow Jar Contents

The final contents of a shadow JAR can be filtered using the `exclude` and `include` methods inherited from Gradle's
`Jar` task type.

Refer to the https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html[Jar] documentation for details
on the various versions of the methods and their behavior.

When using `exclude`/`include` with a `ShadowJar` task, the resulting copy specs are applied to the __final__ JAR
contents.
This means that, the configuration is applied to the individual files from both the project source set or __any__
of the dependencies to be merged.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{tests}/OneClassTest.java[tags=excludeFile]

Excludes and includes can be combined just like a noraml `Jar` task, with `excludes` taking precendence over `includes`.
Additionally, ANT style patterns can be used to match multiple files.
