== Creating a Custom ShadowJar Task

The built in `shadowJar` task only provides an output for the `main` source set of the project.
It is possible to add arbitrary link:{api}/tasks/ShadowJar.html[`ShadowJar`] tasks to a project.
When doing so, ensure that the `configurations` property is specified to inform Shadow which dependencies to merge
into the output.

.Shadowing Test Sources and Dependencies
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
task testJar(type: ShadowJar) {
  classifier = 'tests'
  from sourceSets.test.output
  configurations = [project.configurations.testRuntime]
}
----

The code snippet above will geneated a shadowed JAR contain both the `main` and `test` sources as well as all `runtime`
and `testRuntime` dependencies.
The file is output to `build/libs/<project>-<version>-tests.jar`.
